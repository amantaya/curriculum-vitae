  abstract = {Changes in species distribution in areas with human activity may be the result of either spatial-temporal avoidance of those areas, or as the result of a decrease in survival and recruitment within those areas. My research examined the effects of human activity on the distribution of desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana) along the border in southwestern Arizona, USA and northern Sonora, Mexico. I surveyed 33 transects (256 sites) on foot from February 2017 to January 2018, with 8 of 33 transects re-surveyed during this period. Human use at each site was indexed by trash category (0 pieces of trash, 1-10 pieces of trash, {$>$}10 pieces of trash). Bighorn sheep fecal pellets were used as detections of bighorn sheep. This study used a novel approach to survey replication. Old, white fecal pellets and newer, brown fecal pellets were used as the first and second temporal replicates of a survey, respectively. I used a hierarchical occupancy model to estimate probability of detection and occupancy, with human activity and environmental covariates as explanatory variables. Human activity as indexed by trash had a non-statistically significant but potentially biologically significant negative effect on occupancy. Elevational site position on mountain was positively related to occupancy in Mexico, but not in the USA. Height of the mountain above adjacent valley bottom was positively related to occupancy in the USA, but not in Mexico. These results suggest that bighorn sheep use habitat differently in the USA than in Mexico, likely due to the differences in human activity within each country. Small mountains should be recognized as habitat for desert bighorn sheep, even though in some areas, those features may be infrequently selected by sheep. Conservation efforts should recognize that 'atypical' bighorn sheep habitat may hold value for restoring or maintaining bighorn sheep populations.},

We demonstrate using analytics to identify high- and low-emitting individuals in the herd, which can inform "climate smart" beef premiums. Our example data pipeline can be integrated with other precision technologies to add value, providing insights into livestock production systems and potentially increasing sustainability and operational efficiency.},

  abstract = {Virtual fencing (VF) is tool for livestock management that uses collars and a radio or cellular system to influence the movement of livestock using auditory and electrical cues. Users program the system to establish invisible barriers on a landscape. The system detects the location of animals and if animals approach or cross a ``virtual'' fence, they receive an auditory or electrical cue encouraging them to move away from the barrier. VF systems have the potential to offset physical fencing costs, enable adoption of adaptive management practices, and save ranchers time in locating animals, among other benefits. Meanwhile, commercial VF systems have different fee structures and require labor to operate. This analysis explores economic considerations of investment in virtual fence (VF) systems, examining its application for representative cow-calf operations in Arizona.},

  abstract = {Global concern about the environmental impact of livestock production has been increasing over the past decade; consequently, research has focused on mitigating these emissions. Among all devices deployed to access greenhouse gases (GHG), the GreenFeed (GF) system is the most used for grazing systems. Nonetheless, the primary issue about GF use is its higher variability and the low repeatability (R) of GHG measurements in grazing individuals compared to other methods. Thus, this work aimed to assess both environmental and animal factors, as well as the variability of the GF itself, to explain GHG variability in cattle. These evaluations are usually conducted under experimental conditions, but in this work, both the variability and R values of CH4 were analyzed under commercial settings. Three and two GF units were deployed simultaneously in a dry lot and then in a grazing pasture, respectively, on a commercial cattle ranch. To evaluate the variability and R values of GHG, the GF collected enteric emissions, wind speed, wind direction, temperature, and animal data from 175 and 169 Angus heifers in dry lot and pasture settings, respectively. Variance component analyses were used to evaluate the influence of these factors on the GHG measurements. Results showed a coefficient of variation (CV) of CH4 and CO2 measured through the GF of 32\% and 20\%, respectively. Of the total CH4 variation in grazing conditions, 2.73\% was explained by environmental factors and 38.3\% was explained by animal factors, including feeding behavior (4.58\%), between-animal variation (16.4\%), date of the visit (12.5\%), hour of the visits (3.05\%), visits' duration (1.78\%), and number of visits/day (1.25\%). In contrast, in the dry lot, environmental and animal factors explained 7.49\% and 8.58\% of the CH4 variation, respectively. Finally, the GF equipment itself explained 0.15\% and 2.06\% of the variation of the CH4 in the grazing and dry lot conditions, respectively. The R values, measured as the animal variance divided by the sum of animal and error variances, increased linearly (0.094 to 0.23) in the dry lot, while in the grazing settings, it decreased linearly (0.098 to 0.056) from days 1 to 21. This study identified the most influential factors contributing to the variability of GHG emissions and the low R values of CH4 in commercial grazing cattle production, paving the way for enhanced future use of GF devices for reporting GHG emissions in grazing systems.Accurate measurements of enteric methane emissions are becoming increasingly relevant to cattle production. This study evaluated how environmental, animal, and equipment factors influence enteric emissions and their repeatability over time when measured through automated head chamber system devices. Our results will help to understand the main factors affecting the variability of cattle enteric emissions in both dry lot and grazing conditions in commercial settings.},

  abstract = {In Arizona and other western states, ranchers and land managers rely on thousands of miles of permanent wire fencing to manage livestock on extensive rangelands (Hayter 1939; Netz 2004). This type of fencing has improved rangeland conditions in many places by aiding in the application of grazing systems (Holecheck et al. 2011). However, wire fencing can fragment landscape connectivity, pose a risk to wildlife, and is a major financial investment. Moreover, it offers limited flexibility in adjusting pasture size, actively manipulating grazing distribution, or avoiding high-use areas or sensitive habitats within a pasture (Jakes et al. 2018).},
