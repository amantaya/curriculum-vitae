  abstract = {Changes in species distribution in areas with human activity may be the result of either spatial-temporal avoidance of those areas, or as the result of a decrease in survival and recruitment within those areas. My research examined the effects of human activity on the distribution of desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana) along the border in southwestern Arizona, USA and northern Sonora, Mexico. I surveyed 33 transects (256 sites) on foot from February 2017 to January 2018, with 8 of 33 transects re-surveyed during this period. Human use at each site was indexed by trash category (0 pieces of trash, 1-10 pieces of trash, {$>$}10 pieces of trash). Bighorn sheep fecal pellets were used as detections of bighorn sheep. This study used a novel approach to survey replication. Old, white fecal pellets and newer, brown fecal pellets were used as the first and second temporal replicates of a survey, respectively. I used a hierarchical occupancy model to estimate probability of detection and occupancy, with human activity and environmental covariates as explanatory variables. Human activity as indexed by trash had a non-statistically significant but potentially biologically significant negative effect on occupancy. Elevational site position on mountain was positively related to occupancy in Mexico, but not in the USA. Height of the mountain above adjacent valley bottom was positively related to occupancy in the USA, but not in Mexico. These results suggest that bighorn sheep use habitat differently in the USA than in Mexico, likely due to the differences in human activity within each country. Small mountains should be recognized as habitat for desert bighorn sheep, even though in some areas, those features may be infrequently selected by sheep. Conservation efforts should recognize that 'atypical' bighorn sheep habitat may hold value for restoring or maintaining bighorn sheep populations.},

We demonstrate using analytics to identify high- and low-emitting individuals in the herd, which can inform "climate smart" beef premiums. Our example data pipeline can be integrated with other precision technologies to add value, providing insights into livestock production systems and potentially increasing sustainability and operational efficiency.},

  abstract = {Virtual fencing (VF) is tool for livestock management that uses collars and a radio or cellular system to influence the movement of livestock using auditory and electrical cues. Users program the system to establish invisible barriers on a landscape. The system detects the location of animals and if animals approach or cross a “virtual” fence, they receive an auditory or electrical cue encouraging them to move away from the barrier. VF systems have the potential to offset physical fencing costs, enable adoption of adaptive management practices, and save ranchers time in locating animals, among other benefits. Meanwhile, commercial VF systems have different fee structures and require labor to operate. This analysis explores economic considerations of investment in virtual fence (VF) systems, examining its application for representative cow-calf operations in Arizona.},

  abstract = {In Arizona and other western states, ranchers and land managers rely on thousands of miles of permanent wire fencing to manage livestock on extensive rangelands (Hayter 1939; Netz 2004). This type of fencing has improved rangeland conditions in many places by aiding in the application of grazing systems (Holecheck et al. 2011). However, wire fencing can fragment landscape connectivity, pose a risk to wildlife, and is a major financial investment. Moreover, it offers limited flexibility in adjusting pasture size, actively manipulating grazing distribution, or avoiding high-use areas or sensitive habitats within a pasture (Jakes et al. 2018).},
